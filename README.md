# COMP-1210-Fall-2019
This folder contains the projects and activities from COMP 1210 at Auburn University. 
The lowest project grade attained was a 96 (points off for checkstyle).
Final average was 88.9. Please do attend class! I didn't get those bonus points and I'm salty.

Please stay tuned for a generalized translation of the programming techniques used here.
